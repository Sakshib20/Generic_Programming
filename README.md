# 🧬 Generic Programming

> **"Write once, use for any data type."**

This repository explores the paradigm of **Generic Programming**, focusing on designing algorithms and data structures that are independent of specific data types. The goal is to maximize code reusability, efficiency, and type safety without sacrificing performance.
